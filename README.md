# April-Applications-Data-Fetcher
The "Applications with All Info" script retrieves detailed information about opportunities and applicants from the AIESEC API for April 2023, filtering by committee and date. It uses GraphQL to fetch data including applicant details such as ID, name, email, gender, status, and application history. For each opportunity, it gathers data like project name, program details, logistics information, and manager contacts. This data is structured into columns within a Google Sheets tab named "April", with hyperlinks for emails and opportunity links, making it easier to navigate and analyze applicant and opportunity information comprehensively.
